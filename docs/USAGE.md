# Using Jarvis

Start from the repository with `./start.sh`, then open [localhost:4700](http://localhost:4700). Keep that terminal open; Control+C stops the server. The launcher rebuilds the note graph and selects the project-local Ultra environment when enabled. For installation and the feature flags, use the [Ultra guide](../ULTRA-JARVIS.md).

## Notes and the galaxy

The included café notes are fictional examples. Your Markdown belongs under `notes/`; `[[Note Title]]` links form the graph. Search with Command-K, select a star to inspect its note, or use the Notes workspace for reading and editing. Editing requires confirmation and the current file revision. External file edits require a rebuild/restart and browser reload.

Ask a question about a note to receive source chips. Selecting a source reveals the supporting note in the galaxy. Unsupported answers should say when the vault lacks the information. Greetings and general chat do not move the camera to unrelated notes.

Use “remember that…”, “note to self…” or “log this…” to create a capture. Captures become searchable immediately. Notes → Import a document converts bounded PDF/DOCX/XLSX text into Markdown with provenance. Scanned PDFs need OCR first. Personal captures and imports are ignored by Git; keep your own local backup if needed.

Settings → Memory lets you explicitly save or forget preferences. Hybrid search and preferences require their corresponding Ultra flags; the existing keyword retriever remains the fallback.

## Crew and workflows

The top-left glassy crew shows the boss above three workers. Its heading collapses the figures. The activity drawer shows actual models, phases, tools, elapsed time, retries and reported token use. Simple questions leave worker slots unused.

Settings offers automatic routing and reusable analysis, research, code-review and document workflows. Ask for three workers explicitly when you want parallel collaboration. Workers share reports and review available findings; the boss returns one answer. A timed-out worker remains visible and a partial result is labelled. Code review can suggest a patch, but no shell/test execution tool is exposed.

The model chooser under the orb applies an explicit runtime override. “Go back to your normal brain” restores configured routing. Exact unavailable model names are refused rather than substituted. Restarting clears the runtime override. Model IDs, effort profiles, limits and recovery commands are in the [Ultra guide](../ULTRA-JARVIS.md).

## Voice and orb

Click Mic, click the orb or hold Space outside an editable field. Only explicit microphone activation enables listening. The optional “Jarvis” phrase setting gates recognized transcripts after activation; it is not an always-on hotword detector. Stop or interrupt speech through the existing controls.

The orb reflects listening, model activity, actual speech, confirmations and connection status. Appearance, reduced motion and quiet interface sounds are saved on the device. Preview animations in orb settings do not open the microphone or change real controller state.

For native speech recognition, build `sh native/build_voice.sh`. The helper requires an available on-device English recognizer and macOS microphone/speech permissions. A Dictation-disabled error requires enabling Dictation in System Settings. Permission grants belong to the launcher or helper named by macOS. Browser recognition may use browser speech services. Audible output must be checked on the Mac itself.

## Focus

Build `sh native/build_focus.sh` if using the server directly; the launcher builds it automatically. Say “thirty minutes on this” or use the Focus control. Starting from the Jarvis home tab arms the next stable app/tab as the target. To retarget, go to the desired tab and say “lock on this tab”; from Jarvis, that command re-arms the next target.

| Command | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| pause / resume | Freeze or resume the session |
| call me out every thirty seconds | Change the callout interval |
| give me fifteen seconds | Suppress speech temporarily |
| it's okay, I'm doing research | Excuse the current excursion |
| extend by five minutes | Extend the plan |
| end the session / abort | Finish or abort and report |
| drill sergeant mode / normal mode | Change callout tone |

The native card stays across Spaces without taking keyboard focus. The server owns elapsed time and preserves numeric session state across restarts. Unreadable activity freezes accounting. Jarvis home on port 4700 is exempt. The reader distinguishes browser tabs/windows while keeping identities out of the public state and ledgers.

Focus needs macOS Automation access to System Events and the browser, and Accessibility access if requested for the server's launcher. A process started from Terminal and one started from Codex can have different permission grants. If foreground detection fails, inspect the running server's `/focus/diag` or open `/?focusdebug=1`; a fresh Python object is not evidence about that server. The latest known live limitation is documented in [verification](ultra-verification.md).

## Eyes and screen watch

Eyes requests the camera, calibrates upright posture and runs bundled face/pose landmarks locally. It reports presence, head-down posture and slouch flags. Lowering the head is a posture heuristic, not recognition of a phone. Lighting and camera position affect it. Reset upright posture after moving the camera or chair. Stopping Eyes releases the camera and models; it never turns on the microphone.

An explicit “look at me” sends one current webcam image to the configured vision route. Ordinary chat has no webcam image. With Ultra cheap vision enabled, image checks start with Luna; disabling that flag preserves the existing route.

Screen watch uses one Entire Screen share selected through the browser. Local thumbnail comparisons gate cloud checks; unchanged automatic frames are skipped when that feature is enabled. Screen questions reuse the same share. “Stop watching” ends the watch and share. Build `sh native/build_watch.sh` for the native watch indicator.

“Give me three minutes” silences nudges across Focus, Eyes and screen watch. A model-issued watch start is a request, not proof of an active share: the open viewer must confirm the browser share. No screen pixels are retained in the heartbeat or activity monitor.

## Checks and troubleshooting

Run `python3 tools/check_repo.py` and `python3 tools/check_ultra.py --embeddings` for repository and regression checks. With the server active, run full `python3 preflight.py`. It makes real model calls and creates, recalls and removes a disposable capture. API-backend skips are warnings.

The visible `/?focusprobe=1` fixture must run at an actual 1440×900 viewport. Its full title reports each case. It mocks the physical devices, model and timer queue; it does not establish physical camera, audio or foreground-read acceptance.

If port 4700 is occupied, stop the existing Jarvis process in its own terminal. If an optional search dependency/model fails, inspect the fixed status notice and keyword fallback. Never paste credentials into an issue or commit local configuration, runtime journals or personal notes.
